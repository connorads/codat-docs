Our QuickBooks Desktop (QBD) web connector enables SMBs who use QuickBooks Desktop to share their consented accounting data through the Codat platform. The connector utilizes the Intuit Web Connector, a Windows application that runs on the SMB user's local machine. We support the following ways of connecting to QBD:

- QuickBooks Desktop app
- QuickBooks Enterprise Cloud
- Right Networks
