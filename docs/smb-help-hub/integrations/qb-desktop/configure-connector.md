Your financial services provider has requested access to your NetSuite account and its data. They need to view, create or modify your business's financial data so that they can deliver their services to you. They use Codat to establish the connection to your NetSuite account and asked you to follow our NetSuite connection flow.

how to find the file - sam instructions as before, but this time you ll need to do it via quickbooks. 

what does a config file do - it provides our url where to call / the username that it will use to auth with and sets somew default settings (autorun - the delay when the web cnnector will sync at) - to make sure that we basically get fersh data in codat and you dont need manual intervention to upload data. 

the little checkbox hat says whether we can access sensitive information. if you see this, you can leave itunchecked, but it will mean some of the fields will not be available to us. we dont use any of this data so there will not be any detriment to you and the service codat provides.
