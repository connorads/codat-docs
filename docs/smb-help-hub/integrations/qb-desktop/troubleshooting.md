this connector willl not run on mac.. 

call out for the single user and multi user mode. in single user, you may not need a password / not need to choose an administrator type access. 

if you use QBD in single user mode, continue as is. if you use multi user mode, also do what you normally do. if you have a password set up, then you ll need to enter it.
